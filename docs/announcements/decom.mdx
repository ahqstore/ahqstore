Since the beginning of AHQ Store, it was our priority to protect user data. With that in mind, we're deciding to no longer involuntarily collect any data.

## Sooo, What's changed
The following are the key changes:
- We no longer require an "AHQ Store Account"
- You "may" login into "AHQ Store" using GitHub Device Flow, but we'll not collect any data and the access_token will be stored and processed locally
- "Developers" who would contribute to the apps repo (https://github.com/ahqstore/apps) are required to voluntarily share the information as mentioned in the repo's README.md
- The end users will no longer be required to use "AHQ Store Account" to login
- We'll delete all the data that had been stored till now
- Older versions of "AHQ Store" will cease to work
