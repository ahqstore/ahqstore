<Aside type="caution" title="Beware">
We recommend that you use the provided installer to install AHQ Store. This method too will ultimately run the `AHQ Store Installer` when an update will be available
</Aside>

<Steps>
  1. Download the `.msi` and `ahqstore_service.exe` from [here](/download)
  . <Aside title="What is x86_64 and arm64?">If you're not using a snapdragon, you are probably using x86_64 (also caled amd64). If you're unsure, you should use the amd64 binary as arm64 can emulate that</Aside>
  2. Run the `.msi` file and install it
  3. Now, open an elevated terminal in the folder where `ahqstore_service.exe` is
  . <Code lang="ps1" code={'sc create AHQStore binpath="path to service" start=auto\nsc start AHQStore'} />
  4. Done, open start menu and run AHQ Store
