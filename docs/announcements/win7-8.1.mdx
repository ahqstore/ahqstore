excerpt: We're dropping the support for Windows 7 and 8.1

As you would already know that AHQ Store didn't really supported Windows 7 & 8.1 that well, we've decided to drop support of it altogether.

There's really not much to say here either. Still following are some reasons:

### Microsoft Edge and WebView2 ending support for Windows 7 and Windows 8/8.1

> - To get new versions of Microsoft Edge or the WebView2 Runtime with up-to-date
functionality and security, please upgrade to Windows 10 or later. > - We also encourage
developers to end support for Windows 7 and Windows 8/8.1. We acknowledge that this
may not be easy for some developers to do, however ending support for these operating
systems will help keep end users safe from potential security threats and risks as
both operating systems go out of support on January 10th, 2023.

:::
> - Currently Windows 7 and 8 are listed as Tier 1 supported platforms. However,
this has not been true for a long long time. We simply do not have the testing infrastructure.
And with so much software now abandoning Windows 7 and 8 (everything from Git to
Go to every major browser), continuing to provide the little support that we do is
only getting more difficult. There is also a lack of vendor support for these targets.
> - This proposal aims to raise the minimum supported Windows version of current
targets to Windows 10 (first released in 2015) during 2024. But it also leaves open
the door for new targets that can commit to broader support, By having a separate
target we can ensure there are people specifically tasked with supporting legacy
versions of Windows. > > **Proposal** > - Rust 1.75 will be the last to officially
support Windows 7, 8 and 8.1. Support for Windows versions before 10 will end in
February 2024 with Rust 1.76. > - Support for Windows 7 and 8 may continue beyond
these dates through the creation of new "legacy" targets for older Windows versions.
Individuals or organisation(s) who can commit to providing some level of legacy testing
and support should go through the normal process for creating new targets.
