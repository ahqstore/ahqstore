excerpt: We have decided to drop v1.5 from our tagline, to make v2 directly
---
It is to inform that v1.5 that was to fix AHQ Store v1.x has been dropped for v2. v2 will be a major update to AHQ Store, there are several changes including linux support and more bundling format.

:::tip Why not v1.5.x?
  v1.5 was expected to be a small release with a small set of features, but it
  ended up with a massive rewrite of the whole of AHQ Store backend, including
  but not limited to, service rewrite, linux platform support, http server
  rewrite, website rewrite and many more. That's why we're renaming it to AHQ
  Store
:::

Now let's discuss what you could expect in v2

- You, as a developer, may expect `.msi` to become available for use
- You can also expect Linux Support
- We've rewritten our HTML UI in Windows to use Mica UI
- We've remade the service for Windows to use Windows Named Pipes
- Similarly, the Linux service uses its own UdpSocket
- We've made installer for Windows, Debian Linux
- You'll use [ahqstore/apps](https://github.com/ahqstore/apps) to add your app to AHQ Store
- A new config format has been implemented
- AHQ Store will be migrated to Tauri v2
